The two-player asymmetric multiplayer game will have a game dad rushing about trying to child-proof a home while the baby crawls about trying to find ways to injure itself. Drinking soap is always a safe bet, and maybe you can pop yourself in the oven. Oh sure, the game looks all sorts of janky, but it’s a charming idea. Observe"

    "Urltexte" : "HappyMod is just like any other app store, receiving updates for the included apps regularly. You can update your apps by following the directions in the notifications or by checking the store on a regular basis and installing any available updates.\n\nAs far as HappyMod goes, when the store is updated to a newer version, you do NOT have to install it. You can choose to run an older version, something you cannot do with the PlayStore – if you don’t update that, the store will not work. You will also find a NEW section in HappyMod, where you can see the latest additions and updates."
